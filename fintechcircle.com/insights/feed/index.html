<p>The traditional, large, incumbent insurers are often criticised for failing to innovate or disrupt the insurance market and perhaps not without reason. From the death grip of inadequate legacy platforms, to a ‘that’s how we’ve always done it’ mind-set and protocols designed by conservative and hierarchical internal departments, the incumbents have certainly maintained the status quo for how insurance is transacted.</p>
<p>However more C-suite executives in these institutions speak of a desire to innovate, to be ‘digital’ or  disrupt it. This sets a stage for a reexamination of why InsurTech and its associated modern business practices are not being adopted as broadly or with the level of penetration they should.</p>
<p>From the perspective of a non-underwriter who is attempting to use InsurTech to innovate and transact digitally, this chapter will examine the real issues that stand between large organisations that have a desire and awareness to change, but for whom such change is just not happening, as well as the industry specific challenges the monoliths present for InsurTech start-ups:</p>
<p>The format will be a first hand, on-the-ground perspective directed at the C-suite of large insurance institutions based upon the premise that they already understand that innovation and change is required, but are not able to bring this to life.</p>
<p>The C-suite are often acutely aware of the need to adopt new approaches like business-led IT, internal ideation and the need to embrace an acceptable level of failure to learn fast from new ventures, however knowing where you want to be doesn’t ensure you to get there.</p>
<p>Using specific and real-life first hand examples of where innovation potential is often thwarted and where the bright spots exist, this chapter will talk to what is actually happening in the industry today, the challenges, and the potential solutions.</p>

<p>There’s a risk increasing investment in technology that will only add more complexity to the industry. There’s a risk technology will be used for the sake of it. And there’s a risk of overwhelming uniformity. The answer? Design. There’s an issue with trust in the insurance industry. This stems from consumers not knowing what they’re covered for. This is caused by long and complex policy documents that are hard to understand. One way to overcome this is by using design to simplify how you communicate to your customer what they’re covered for.</p>
<p>By following some common principles of design and relentlessly striving for simplification, you can build trust with consumers, by designing your service in a way consumers can understand what you’re saying. Fundamentally design is about people. It’s about starting with the end user and getting to know their needs, desires and pains before you start creating anything. Only when you know this should you start thinking about what service you’re going to create.</p>
<p>Investing in technology without exploring your customer’s real needs is a great way to end up with something that nobody wants. So cut through the InsurTech hype. Start with your users. We live in a world of abundance. With the cost of technology decreasing and technology becoming easier to work with, the barriers to entry for creating your own service are declining.</p>
<p>We’re seeing this in the InsurTech industry. And the dynamics of competition and differentiation are changing as a result. It’s not enough to create a reasonably priced product that’s adequately functional. In an age of abundance, appealing only to rational and functional needs is extremely insufficient. One of the best ways for businesses to differentiate their services is to make their offering beautiful and emotionally compelling. Design to simplify. Design to operate. Design to differentiate<strong>.</strong></p>

<p>Is segmentation still relevant for the industry today? Digital has dramatically impacted the way organisations engage with customers, and as such have to review it&#8217;s business models.The expectations of the customer base in insurance have already transcended traditional segments (e.g. gender, age, etc.), and becoming pervasive not only in customer experiential requirements for products and services, but also existing business models.</p>
<p>Verticals creating and servicing traditional product lines are blurred as organisations cross the divide to experiential and customer centricity management constructs.</p>
<p>For example, youth, mass and HNIs segmentation is no longer relevant as the demands across these verticals become common place with minimal differentiation. Personalisation is no longer a requirement for only the highly profitable consumer, but has become a right for all consumers in the insurance services eco system. The development of personas and ethnographic studies has become as relevant as ever. One may argue the evolution to personas is equivalent to segmentation, however, personas convey behaviours, journeys and experiences of engagement.</p>
<p>Businesses’ shift in response to customers’ demands will significantly be driven by UX design and data insights. The effect of ‘when’ and ‘how’ organisations respond to customer moments of truth or life events, will impact and become a catalyst for amalgamation of business verticals. Will establishing data centres and data science as a skill become a pre-requisite for incumbent organisations? Data is increasingly becoming a critical enabler, these imperatives will be key strategic levers for remaining relevant and competitive.</p>
<p>As organisations become entrenched in the digital eco-system, the processes and models for developing client offers will follow the same design processes, i.e. designing for experience. Cross product definitions, and promoting simplicity with high value impact, will emerge and encourage adoption across multiple consumer personas. Product and service offering can no longer be developed on margin and propensity of profitability of an identified segment.</p>
<p>A ‘boxed’ or prescriptive customer model is no longer sustainable nor sufficient for insurance organisation but the (un)relevance thereof is.</p>

<p>Clients have changed. Today&#8217;s wealth creators are increasingly entrepreneurs, younger, more hands-on in their investments and distrusting of Wall Street. They struggle to engage with traditional wealth management propositions. This client base turns increasingly to private assets (private equity, private debt, real estate and other alternatives) for vast portions of their investments.</p>
<p>If this trend continues, at best, our industry becomes a laughing stock when we claim to talk about being holistic yet offering no solutions for, in some estimates, half of our clients assets or, at worst, an existential problem whereby the pool of investable assets is shrinking. To stay relevant to the clients of today and tomorrow we need to bring private assets to the forefront of a wealth management solution.</p>
<p>Done correctly, private assets moves beyond relevancy and extends to differentiation. This is an area with less commoditisation which allows reduced fee pressure but also an opportunity to curate an offering which allows organisations to stand out from the crowd to attract and engage clients in the current competitive environment.</p>
<p>The challenges of building a private asset proposition are well understood; compliance, engagement and scalability being the most prominent in board rooms we sit in. That said, these need to be overcome to stay part of our clients hearts and that is where technology can play a key role. Multiple platforms are emerging which facilitate the connectivity between HNW clients and private investment opportunities.</p>
<p>However, for this to be embedded in the wealth management proposition a solution must be tailored to the needs of the firm, their clients, and their business objectives; appropriate deal flow has to be sourced and curated, relationship managers need to be empowered, not replaced and compliance must be front and centre. Technology can be used to overcome these obstacles.</p>

<p>Like a flywheel gaining momentum, emerging tech-driven user experiences and business models are raising customer expectations – which in turn accelerate further WealthTECH innovation.</p>
<p>But where is all this acceleration leading? Future investors seem certain to have better, faster, cheaper platforms than the fragmented offerings of traditional financial services.</p>
<p>A huge pain point keeping many consumers from making the most of their money is the need to juggle numerous apps and websites to manage their financial lives – bank and investment accounts, credit cards, auto loans, student loans, personal loans, home loans and more. Each with its own rules, passwords and learning curve.</p>
<p>What’s the WealthTECH experience? The promise of platforms and the “API economy” is that consumers can combine products and services for their unique financial needs, and providers can deliver far more value with integrated than standalone services.</p>
<p>A single, holistic view of financial health and happiness for investors – and all consumers – is a great concept, but we’re not there yet. What would it look like? An interactive balance sheet? A dashboard? An App store?</p>
<p><strong><em>Some major challenges to overcome on the way to WealthTECH:</em></strong></p>
<p>&#8211; Trust and transparency</p>
<p>&#8211; Compatibility and consistency</p>
<p>&#8211; Ease of use</p>
<p>&#8211; Security</p>
<p>&#8211; Artificial and natural intelligence</p>
<p>&#8211; Fiduciary responsibility</p>
<p>&#8211; Performance</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Will it change the world?</p>
<p>WealthTECH looks certain to help people lead better financial lives, but how many lives can it touch? The potential is far beyond helping investors grow their portfolios.</p>
<p>It’s an opportunity to include the Next Billion – the world’s unconnected and unbanked who are coming online each day.</p>
<p>Democratizing finance with broader access to more services at less cost can bring unprecedented investors, ideas, and opportunities into the financial world, creating the proverbial bigger pie for everyone. After all, why stop at changing an industry when there is a chance to change the world?</p>

<p>Millennials are stated to be the key customer segment for almost every new business model in the Fintech space. WealthTechs are addressing the needs of Millennials and hence are expected to change the investments sector as we know it substantially. But are Millennials and WealthTechs really powerful enough to disrupt the whole investments market?</p>
<p>Millennials don´t have the money yet! Millennials are defined as people born between 1980 and 2000. Given this, most of them currently still don´t have the financial background to be a potential customer for banks operating in the investments-space. However, Millennials are going to be the most tech-oriented generation so far and they differ significantly from previous generations, e.g. they have the highest density of young academics and are the first generation growing up with digital devices and the Internet. Thus, Millennialsare an attractive segment for investment-providers, online or offline. This leads to an enormous potential for WealthTechs – in the future.</p>
<p>Millennials have the highest potential lifetime value and WealthTechs are aiming for them.</p>
<p>The new wave of WealthTechs addresses their potential customers – primarily Millennials – through simplified client on boarding and investment processes, intuitive interfaces and entirely new customer experiences due to digital processes and 24/7 customer service. On top of that, new digital technologies offer unprecedented (theoretical) scaling potential, hence they´re able to more rapidly acquire new customers compared to traditional banks. Especially older Millennials like HENRY´s (High Earnings Not Rich Yet) are targeted as an ideal customer sub segment for WealthTechs.</p>
<p>Adopt and gain spill-over effects!</p>
<p>WealthTechs primarily address Millennials, but their features and use cases appear to be also compelling for more profitable customers from older generations, hence we will expect substantial spill-over effects into a broader audience. Traditional banks are on the way to create attractive digital propositions for Millennials as well – based on an existing customer base and financial resources. Nevertheless WealthTechs may change the investment sector substantially, if they are able to remain quicker and closer to the needs of the Millennials.</p>

</strong>Liberal markets are organised to allow users and providers of services the ability to interact without interference by third parties. They are a central element of market capitalism and have been established in many economies as an element of daily interaction.</p>
<p>In each of these markets, we encounter rogue behaviour leading to damages suffered by users of services or products offered. The standard reaction is to implement or tighten regulations that are supposed to ascertain that such behaviour is stopped. This is true for any market, including the provision of financial services.</p>
<p>So far, regulation in financial services is almost exclusively targeting the intermediaries that act as providers of such services. However, with the advent of decentralised business models (inter alia blockchain-based models) and knowledge-based systems that cut out the middle-man, the whole approach for whom we regulate and which measures we use to create trustworthy interactions will have to be redesigned as well.</p>
<p>In a fully decentralised marketplace, there are only buyers and sellers of services as well as the software connecting the two. Regulation based on managing the behaviour of the intermediary will simply be void once decentralised business models take hold within the community. In the case of e.g. securities issuance on a blockchain, we can regulate the issuer as well as the buyer of securities, but no longer the bank connecting the two.</p>
<p>We therefore need to re-frame the regulatory approach and start designing rules that take user behaviour and programmers’ skills and intentions into account and e.g. measure the users’ ability to understand the implications of their actions in the markets. This will include a certification mechanism measuring users&#8217; understanding of the markets they are active in as well as a certificate-issuing authority for software developers that design de-centralised systems in relevant markets. Such a new paradigm will initiate a completely new segment of the RegTech market to establish itself as a central offering for all platform models.</p>

<p>Regulatory Technology (RegTech) is not confined to just revolutionising the financial services or FinTech industry. Indeed it has the potential to spur numerous breakthroughs in diverse areas such as consumer protection and environmental sustainability among others.</p>
<p>RegTech can ensure the effectiveness of environmental regulatory measures such as cap-and-trade greenhouse gas reduction schemes aimed at tackling climate change. Cap-and-trade measures allow businesses to trade a certain number of ‘carbon credits’. Thus, polluting enterprises are required to purchase the right to pollute from companies that are either not involved in very carbon-intensive activities, or from those that have already installed the necessary technological improvements that curb emissions and hence have an excess of carbon credits at their disposal.</p>
<p>At the same time, the overall level of emissions is held constant, so that emissions credits are being redistributed to those willing to pay the market price for pollution. However, a major problem with global cap-and-trade schemes is the double counting that occurs when emissions reductions are being counted twice, both on the books of the seller and the buyer of the carbon credits.</p>
<p>RegTech has the potential to streamline and even revolutionise the monitoring of cap-and-trade schemes. This can be done through the adoption of ‘smart meters’ in the premises of polluting enterprises, which measure and report real-time data of a company’s emissions. Compliance can also be facilitated by ‘smart contracts’, which make sure that both parties are aware of their reporting and monitoring obligations, so that no double counting occurs.</p>
<p>Correctly tracing, reviewing and taking account of the data generated by carbon-intensive enterprises and industries, with the help of RegTech has the potential to restore the credibility of flailing carbon trading projects and to ensure that they result in substantive environmental improvements.</p>

<p>The relationship between regulation and the adoption of new digital technologies in emerging markets still lack proper incentives to innovate and adopt and are giving room to the paradox according to which, even though the 4th revolution offers access to new technologies at a very low cost, emerging economies are still not vigilant and adopting them, due &#8211; among other causes, mainly to two critical factors: poor regulation (excessive or simply, obsolete and deficient) and lack of incentives for local and international investors and entrepreneurs to massively invest in such technologies in those countries.</p>
<p>Digital technology is providing the right path to democratize and give low income population more access to several services (such as financial services) but regulation in developing countries is yet not ready to back up the changes implied with the adoption of such technologies (new businesses models, disintermediation, blockchain instead of central deposits, privacy and, cybersecurity issues, new insurance product needs, among other situations).</p>
<p>There are huge opportunities that RegTech offers to emerging countries in terms of closing social gaps, expanding financial inclusion,democratising certain services and allowing the entrance of new players to long time and &#8216;well-established&#8217; markets (entering as new competitors or allies of larger corporations) making those economies more ready to compete in the new global landscape where AI, cloud services, AR, Fintech, Blockchain and IoT promise to profoundly impact our lifestyles, consuming habits, interaction with others (including our companies’ stakeholders) and working force dynamics.</p>

<p>When the year 2008 is mentioned, it is generally associated with the demise of Lehman Brothers and the ensuing financial chaos. Yet, for all the economic damage that the financial crisis caused, the year 2008 in fact marked the genesis of a societal phenomenon far more pervasive, divisive and corrosive than may initially have been appreciated.</p>
<p>In short, the crisis in which the world is enmired is not just financial in nature: what we are experiencing is a profound and unprecedented crisis of trust, confidence and legitimacy with regard to the public servants who govern us and the organizations that serve us.</p>
<p>From a macro perspective, the world economy has never known so much wealth, and yet never before has the global prosperity gap been so enormous. So where does Regulatory Technology fit into this picture? RegTech is currently touted as being the next ‘big thing’ to hit the Financial Services industry, serving primarily to reduce the cost and complexity of complying with the myriad regulations been enacted since the financial crisis.</p>
<p>But what if RegTech could do more than ‘just’ reduce the cost and complexity of compliance within the confines of a system that is increasingly acknowledged to no longer serve its societal purpose? Regulation does not exist in a vacuum, and neither does technology: both evolve organically in a geo-political and economic context, and the direction their development takes is conditioned by the policies and decisions that in turn shape the societies in which we live.</p>
<p>What if RegTech could jumpstart new thought processes around broad-based collaboration between industry stakeholders, inciting new regulatory approaches to support financially inclusive policies that foster social mobility?</p>
<p>What if RegTech becomes an integral part of the ‘soft infrastructure’ necessary to support a new model? Imagine the full realm of possibilities when RegTech ceases to be just a bankable buzzword and becomes a movement, embodied by people who yearn for ‘better’ and who are emboldened by this powerful purpose.</p>
