<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This month we conducted a study which found that so-called “FinTech experts” may not be as knowledgeable as they claim. <strong>We uncovered that 94% of financial services professionals suspect their colleagues of using buzzwords such as “Blockchain” and “Artificial Intelligence” without understanding their meaning. </strong>Over half (60%) claim that such bluffing is a common occurrence.</p>
<p>The industry professionals questioned felt that lack of training within financial services organisations was the biggest factor preventing some employees from developing their digital and FinTech skills, with 69% making this claim. Meanwhile, 22% say financial services professionals are putting off developing their digital skills out of fear that it’s too late to catch up with existing FinTech experts.</p>
<p>This is despite the vast majority of financial services professionals believing that promotions should favour the most tech-savvy employees, meaning traditional financial services experts could be at risk of falling behind their digital-friendly colleagues. Of the 1,400 people questioned, 84% claimed that colleagues with advanced digital and FinTech skills, but half the years of experience, are more deserving of promotion than a colleague who has been in the industry for at least ten years.</p>
<p>I personally think it&#8217;s worrying that financial services professionals believe it’s too late to build their digital and FinTech skills, while others are bluffing their skillset&#8230; As the study shows, in today’s financial services industry, there is a direct link between genuine digital knowledge and promotion prospects.

<p>Things have changed in the world of insurance. Breaking from tradition, the industry is focused on new propositions, new customers, new competition and new data.</p>
<p>Established insurers are being disrupted by Insurtech start-ups. Well-funded and agile, these smaller start-ups are introducing transparency into the market and employing new ways to analyse new data.</p>
<p>Celent’s consensus is that there are 600-800 InsurTech start-ups globally focussing on four main themes:</p>
<p>Customers want convenience – and are willing to pay for it. Pay-by-the-usage is now just a click away.</p>
<p><strong>On-demand protection: </strong>The demand for innovation within the sector means<br />
greater investment in interactive technologies. AI-powered insurance app,<br />
anyone?</p>
<p><strong>Improved customer engagement via new propositions: </strong> Connected homes, people and systems offer new sources of real-time, meaningful data that allow insurers to learn how their customers behave.</p>
<p><strong>The Internet of Things: </strong>Leveraging the power of the community to provide affordable insurance, this model is now starting to use blockchain too.</p>
<p><strong>Peer-to-peer insurance: </strong>Things have changed in insurance and InsurTechs have been quick to grasp this. One of the biggest drivers of change has been the approach to data analysis.</p>
<p>Insurtechs have rapidly adopted renegade approaches to dealing with big data. Traditional, bureaucratic models of analysing data are out, and smart, new, fast, effective data analysis is in.</p>
<p>To maximise leveraging the value of data analysis, insurers should link everything they do to one of four SMART objectives:</p>

<p>Women set to bag more top roles in the future as government’s push for greater diversity in financial services gathers pace.</p>
<p>Over two-thirds of finance firms believe that signing up to the Treasury’s Women in Finance Charter will lead to the permanent and sustainable change in gender diversity at senior levels across the industry.</p>
<p>According to new research, conducted by think tank New Financial, 62% of firms have taken specific action to support female career progression since signing up to the Charter – an initiative which aims to build the pipeline of female talent for leadership positions.</p>
<p>FINTECH Circle is a proud member of #WomeninFinance.</p>

<p>The final day was to hold our attention to the last. Strong themes of open banking, payments and security continued to be debated on the 5 Tracking Stages. Speakers from Nordea, Deutshe Bank and Saxo Payments took the conversation beyond payments and considered transaction banking as the next wave of innovation with cash management, trade finance and risk management.</p>
<p>Identification continued to be a headline topic with the role of financial services in creating digital identities. Speakers from Bitfury, Santander and Capital One represented an ecosystem that is transforming at speed without compromising on security. As the FinTech revolution moves ahead will customers trust new systems that hold the key to their finances and online identities?</p>
<p>Zennon Kapron and and Marie Aquino from Kapronasia started the day in Track Room 2 with ‘China, A Day In the Life: How Digital Finance Influences The Way That 1.5 Billion People Pay, Shop and Save’. What has become abundantly apparent is that the largest FinTech market in the world has matured and continues to move into international markets. As a case study into the way FinTech might effect the way financial services operate and how diverse these products and services can be, this presentation gave a glimpse into future of what might be for Europe and the rest of the world.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-626 size-full aligncenter" src="http://fintechcircle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/alipay-e1499273991610.jpg" alt="learn fintech" width="664" height="498" /></p>
<p>After lunch the Keynote Stage began with Rita Liu, Head of EMEA, Alipay. With over 450 million users in China, Alipay has been working with companies overseas and with mobile wallet partnerships across countries such as India, Thailand, Vietnam and South Korea.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-622 size-full aligncenter" src="http://fintechcircle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/DDZ_T4cXoAEK4um-e1499274271151.jpg" alt="fintech fund" width="664" height="498" /></p>
<p>Next on Stage was Jonathan Larsen Chief Innovation Officer, Ping An Group, Chairman and CEO, Pin An Voyager Fund representing one of the largest FinTech funds in the world.</p>
<p>Will Gaybrick, Chief Financial Officer, Stripe followed giving a mind opening presentation of the nature of money and value. As a theory from a payments point of view the velocity of movement over amounts held is what drives a successful economy.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-621 size-full aligncenter" src="http://fintechcircle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/DDazO9YWAAMPvnn-e1499275512449.jpg" alt="fintech course" width="664" height="443" /></p>
<p>The event ended on a high with the winning presentation of the BBVA Open Talent Competition for AI awarded to Change, and the winning pitch from Money 2020 Startups went to NewBanking with EnterpriseBot and GetPenta in second and third place.</p>
<p>My overall impression of the event was that both Money 2020 and the FinTech industry as whole has consolidated. FinTech is now at the head of financial services and the conversation is moving from speculation to results. What struck me the most was the innovation echo chamber seems to be thankfully on the decline and is being replaced by candid conversations about the new data that’s coming in from digital transformation and the questions that are arising from it.</p>
<p>Money 2020 continues to deliver a unique and valuable experience for anyone in finance and technology. With an eye on Google news search as announcements were made live, I could see that for three days Copenhagen was central to the future of finance.</p>

<p>Today felt like the conference had gained momentum. With some of the biggest names in finance and technology on the agenda expectations were high for another day at Money 2020.</p>
<p>The main themes were Bank (R)evolution, Entrepreneurship and Investing, Legal and Regulatory,  Mobile Payments and Wallets, New Market Research, Next Gen Retail and Commerce, Processing Open Platforms, and X-Border Disruption.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-557" src="http://fintechcircle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DDU-ewXUAEEfwW.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="900" srcset="http://2wpln01kngf046rqb1fkwlit.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DDU-ewXUAEEfwW.jpg 1200w, http://2wpln01kngf046rqb1fkwlit.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DDU-ewXUAEEfwW-300x225.jpg 300w, http://2wpln01kngf046rqb1fkwlit.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DDU-ewXUAEEfwW-768x576.jpg 768w, http://2wpln01kngf046rqb1fkwlit.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DDU-ewXUAEEfwW-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px" /></p>
<p>Along with announcements and case studies Jim McCarthy from Visa shared an exclusive with the audience that they had equity invested in Klarna and then invited CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski<em> </em>onto the stage to discuss their collaboration.</p>
<p>A strong theme of open banking and API ran through most of the day with speakers from BBVA, HSBC, Fidor Bank, Lloyds, and Danske Bank.</p>
<p>With the focus ever more on the customer, sessions on UX ran all morning including Putting Emotion Back in Banking, Human Simple and Powerful and Where AI and UX meet.</p>

<p>Both Google and Amazon featured on the Keynote stage during the afternoon. Giulio Montemagno from Amazon Pay gave an impressive presentation on how to deliver to consumers who want results instantly and with end to end personalisation.  David Birch interviewed Gerardo Capiel about how Google could leverage the huge amount of data and payment details they have to create better customer experiences.</p>
<p>As the afternoon started to draw to an end I searched out some of the more early stage, esoteric sessions and chose Virtual Reality and the Monetisation of Immersive Content. I wasn&#8217;t disappointed, with the final thought of the day coming from Danny Lange of Unity Technology: If VR payments can read not only your eye movements, but also your heart rate and other vital biometrics, the potential for machine learning recommendation engines based on this data is huge.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-547" src="http://fintechcircle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Capture-4.png" alt="" width="722" height="539" srcset="http://2wpln01kngf046rqb1fkwlit.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Capture-4.png 722w, http://2wpln01kngf046rqb1fkwlit.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Capture-4-300x224.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 722px) 100vw, 722px" /></p>
<p>Jack Dorsey started the event speaking to one of the biggest FinTech conference gatherings I&#8217;ve seen yet.  His first words were, &#8216;Wow, big con!&#8217;.</p>
<p>Talking about his experience rolling out Square into Europe and his vision of how the act of payment can almost disappear, he ended on the importance of &#8216;doing&#8217; over &#8216;thinking&#8217;.</p>
<p>The visual styling of the event is worth a mention. With back drops, signage and agenda done in a 1950&#8217;s superhero comic theme, Money 2020 managed to pull off an element of fun. No small thing in the world of finance and technology.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-549" src="http://fintechcircle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Capture-5.png" alt="" width="732" height="537" srcset="http://2wpln01kngf046rqb1fkwlit.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Capture-5.png 732w, http://2wpln01kngf046rqb1fkwlit.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Capture-5-300x220.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 732px) 100vw, 732px" /></p>
<p>With 6 stages in total to choose from subjects included &#8216;The Pulse of Fintech&#8217;, &#8216;Red Hot, Insurtech In the Limelight and Banking As A Service: Enhancing Value.  After Lunch I decided to spend my last few hours of the day immersing myself in the world of payments.  Especially memorable was a &#8216;Disruptive Payments Infrastructures&#8217; panel that included Daniel Marovitz from Earthport and Yobie Benjamin the CTO of Token.io.</p>
<p>My overall sense of the first day made me think back a couple of years when the conversation often centered around whether FinTech was going to become mainstream.  This has now happened and the conversation is changing once again.</p>
<p>Tomorrow guest speakers from Google and Amazon will be found on the Keynote stage with expert panels running simultaneously on the 5 Tracking Room stages. Ideas will be progressed along as thousands of attendees engage.  I cant help but think that in among the crowds of Money 2020 this year another piece of FinTech history will be made.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To read the full interview by Simon Cocking, Editor of The Irish Tech News <a href="http://irishtechnews.ie/do-you-have-something-to-say-about-fintech-pitch-your-idea-for-the-2017-fintech-books-susanne-chishti-explains-more/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
<p><strong>What is your background briefly?</strong></p>
<p>I started to work for a fintech company called Tandem Computers (now part of HP) 20 years ago in the Silicon Valley before the term “fintech” existed. It was not until 2014 when I attended several fintech events in London and all of a sudden I had this feeling again, that I felt 20 years earlier in the Silicon Valley. This time I knew that FINTECH would become big and that it would fundamentally change our lives the same way the internet did before. FINTECH was the answer we were waiting for after the Financial Crisis.</p>
<p><strong>Does it seem a logical progression to what you do now?</strong></p>
<p>I started on the technology side, then went to the finance side and now I am able to combine both, so all of sudden my life makes sense again! In 2014 I set up FINTECH Circle as Europe’s 1st Angel Network focused on fintech opportunities. Our focus is to help fintech founders when they want to raise seed capital for the first time. The next application deadline to submit a funding proposal to our Angel Network is the <strong>31 January</strong>, you can submit it <a href="http://t.sidekickopen68.com/e1t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7lC8dDMPbW2n0x6l2B9nMJN7t5XYgd0QGsW6442D85v0JxPW3LqXLC56dMbyf3n5xWs02?t=http%3A%2F%2Ffintechcircle.com%2Finvest%2F&amp;si=6087052159090688&amp;pi=afa80319-2bab-4358-ab66-57a7658e887f" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><strong>online</strong></a>.</p>
<p><strong>What does FINTECH Circle do? 1 min pitch?</strong></p>
<p>In addition to being an Angel Network, we are a <a href="http://t.sidekickopen68.com/e1t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7lC8dDMPbW2n0x6l2B9nMJN7t5XYgd0QGsW6442D85v0JxPW3LqXLC56dMbyf3n5xWs02?t=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fgroups%2F8184397&amp;si=6087052159090688&amp;pi=afa80319-2bab-4358-ab66-57a7658e887f" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><strong>global community of FINTECH entrepreneurs, investors and thought-leaders</strong></a> on LinkedIn<strong>. </strong>We are also an <strong>Open API Platform Partner</strong> working with banks &amp; insurance firms and technology providers who aim to collaborate with the best fintech companies to create long-term value for their customers and shareholders. The power of an effective open API strategy can be huge in helping transform an organization, it can even guarantee its survival.</p>
<p>We also run a <strong>WealthTECH Advisory Practise</strong> with superior fintech companies and experts across investment management, robo-advisory and new technologies such as Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning, crowdsourced alpha, Blockchain etc to help Private Banks &amp; Asset Managers to leverage the fintech solutions out there.</p>
<p><strong>How was 2016, what went well?</strong></p>
<p>During 2016 Fintech became mainstream. We became a global enterprise working on projects for financial institutions across Europe and even as far afield as Australia, helping design and fulfil on FinTech innovation mandates. We also announced a very exciting and strategic partnership focusing on <a href="http://t.sidekickopen68.com/e1t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7lC8dDMPbW2n0x6l2B9nMJN7t5XYgd0QGsW6442D85v0JxPW3LqXLC56dMbyf3n5xWs02?t=http%3A%2F%2Fventureburn.com%2F2016%2F11%2Ffintech-circle-innovate-announce-partnership-citi%2F&amp;si=6087052159090688&amp;pi=8c926fbe-37cf-447b-d426-af1fb64393c3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">FinTech in Africa</a> with CiTi.</p>
<p>We launched <a href="http://t.sidekickopen68.com/e1t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7lC8dDMPbW2n0x6l2B9nMJN7t5XYgd0QGsW6442D85v0JxPW3LqXLC56dMbyf3n5xWs02?t=http%3A%2F%2Feu.wiley.com%2FWileyCDA%2FWileyTitle%2FproductCd-111921887X.html&amp;si=6087052159090688&amp;pi=afa80319-2bab-4358-ab66-57a7658e887f" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><strong>The FINTECH Book</strong></a> in March 2016 and by the end of the year it became a global bestseller (sold more than 10,000 copies worldwide). We celebrated the launch in many countries and it was always a great feeling when our authors met for the first time in person and signed all the books together and then presented on stage in various countries. Lots of fintech friendships were the result.</p>
<p>Finally, there is huge demand for proper Fintech education. As a result we designed the first <a href="http://t.sidekickopen68.com/e1t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7lC8dDMPbW2n0x6l2B9nMJN7t5XYgd0QGsW6442D85v0JxPW3LqXLC56dMbyf3n5xWs02?t=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.escpeurope.eu%2Fnc%2Fmedia-news%2Fevents-and-fairs-escp-europe%2Fcalendar%2Fevent%2Fcalendar%2Fcertified_fintech_course_2_day_seminar%2F20161207%2Fevent%2Ftx_cal_phpicalendar%2F&amp;si=6087052159090688&amp;pi=8c926fbe-37cf-447b-d426-af1fb64393c3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><strong>certified FINTECH Course</strong></a> in Europe in cooperation with ESCP Europe, a leading European university with campuses in the UK and across Europe. We will soon announce the 2017 FINTECH Curriculum at ESCP Europe – so stay tuned!</p>
<p><strong>What inspired you to do three more Fintech books in 2017, and how did you chose those particular topics?</strong></p>
<p>2016 was the year Fintech went mainstream and 2017 will be the year when fintech verticals such as <strong>insurtech </strong>(innovation across the insurance sector), <strong>wealthtech </strong>(innovation across the Investment- and Wealth management sectors) and <strong>regtech </strong>(innovation across compliance solutions to meet regulatory requirements) will really take off. This year it won’t be enough to talk about fintech strategies anymore, but people want to see results. That’s why we are launching 3 new books:</p>
